# LibraryConsoleApp
For the project's domain we have 2 classes: Book and BookLend, the book can be in multiple lends but you can only borrow one book so we have a one to many relationship.
Then we have the Library class. The library will handle all the actions related to it's books. 
The menu handles all the interaction with the user
I used the isbn as a primary key (as i read on the internet it should be unique depending on the book). Most book identifying will be based on the isbn. 
In the program you can find 2 list with books and user lends.
You can't change the date in the app, you can change the start that of the ones in the list or add new ones
